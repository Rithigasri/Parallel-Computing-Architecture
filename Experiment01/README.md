# EXPERIMENT 01:GPU BASED VECTOR SUMMARIZATION 
i) Using the program sumArraysOnGPU-timer.cu, set the block.x = 1023. Recompile and run it. Compare the result with the execution configuration of block.x = 1024. Try to explain the difference and the reason.
ii) Refer to sumArraysOnGPU-timer.cu, and let block.x = 256. Make a new kernel to let each thread handle two elements. Compare the results with other execution confi gurations.
